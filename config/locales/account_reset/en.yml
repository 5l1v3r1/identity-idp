      info: Deleting your account should be your last resort if you are locked out
        of your account. You will not be able to recover any information linked to
        your account.  Once your account is deleted, you can create a new one using
        the same email address.

    request:
      access_your_account: access your account
      are_you_sure: Are you sure you don't have access to any of your security methods
        OR your personal key?
      delete_account: Delete your account
      delete_account_info: Deleting your existing account and creating a new one will
        allow you to use the same email address and set up new security options.  However,
        deleting will remove any agency applications you have linked to your account
        and you will need to restore each connection. <br><br> If you continue, you
        will first receive an email confirmation.  As a security measure, you will
        receive another email with the link to continue deleting your account 24 hours
        after the initial confirmation email arrives.
      info: If you can't access your account through the security options you set
        up previously, deleting your account and creating a new one is the only option.
        <br><br> We can't undo an account delete, so please make sure you don't have
        another security option you can use instead like your personal key.
      no_cancel: No, cancel
      personal_key: Do you have your personal key?
      personal_key_info: Your personal key is a 16 character code that was given to
        you at account creation as a recovery method--see example below.

        instead of resetting.
      title: Account deletion and reset
